 Best practices 

_!_ use camelCase for naming a variable like firstName ,lastName

_!_ all the vaiable should be declared on the top of the page and you must initialize it with something when you dont have any information you can use EMPTY or 0 

like : 	let firstName="";
	let age=0; 

_!_ avoid unnecessary variables

_!_ must use default in switch case 

_!_ declare object and array with CONST

_!_ dont use == in checking values use === instade 

_!_ dont access DOM if theres another way find another way first coz its a slow process.
